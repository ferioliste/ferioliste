# Hey there! 👋

I am Stefano Ferioli and I am currently pursuing a Master in Applied Mathematics at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, with a minor in Data Science. My interests range over many areas, including statistics, machine learning, linear algebra applications, and quantitative finance.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Below are most of the projects I have worked on during my academic journey, covering topics in numerical analysis, machine learning, finance, and algorithmic optimization.

## My projects

**Sensitivities in Finance** - *Fall 2024* \
The Greeks in finance measure how option prices react to market factors, like price, volatility, and interest rate. This project explores three Monte Carlo approaches to compute Delta, Vega, and Gamma under the Black–Scholes model. \

**The recipe for a successful movie** - *Fall 2024* \
This project analyzes a dataset to explore the factors that contribute to a film's success. First, we argue what success really means in the context of the film industry, considering multiple dimensions such as the box office revenue, the critical acclaim, and the ROI. Then, we examine a range of factors that may influence these success metrics, including genres, casts' composition, production companies and country of origin. \

**Estimating the 2-norm of the columns of a matrix** - *Fall 2024* \
Approximating the 2-norm of each column of a matrix is a very important problem in computational linear algebra. This project develops and implements a randomized algorithm that leverages probabilistic techniques to approximate these norms efficiently. \

**Conway's Game of Life** - *Summer 2024* \
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway, where cells evolve over discrete time steps based on three simple rules. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life generates highly complex and unpredictable patterns, making it a fascinating study in artificial life, mathematics, and computer science. This repository contains an interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. \

**Dealing with sparse rewards in the Mountain Car environment** - *Spring 2024* \
The Mountain Car problem is a classic example in the field of reinforcement learning where the goal is to drive an underpowered car up a steep hill. An agent must learn to leverage potential energy of the car by oscillating back and forth to build enough momentum to reach the top of the hill on the right. This project explores different solutions using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dyna agents, combining model-free and model-based approaches. \

**Randomized algorithms for tensor train approximation** - *Spring 2024* \
The tensor train format (TT-format) allows the representation of a tensor through the contraction of several three-dimensional tensors called TT-cores. This project explores how randomization can be used to achieve performance improvements in TT-factorization and TT-rounding algorithms. \

**NUFFT-II Implementation** - *Spring 2024* \
Computing the non-uniform discrete Fourier transforms can be very expensive with naive methods. This repository provides an efficient implementation using Chebyshev and Taylor-based low-rank approximations to speed up the computation while maintaining accuracy. \

**Label Propagation via Diffusion on a Graph** - *Fall 2023* \
Given a classification problem with very little labelled data, this project explores an algorithm that allows to propagate the known labels by exploiting the geometric structure of the data. \

**Randomized Nyström Algorithm** - *Fall 2023* \
Approximating large symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrices is computationally expensive. This project implements and tests the Randomized Nyström Algorithm using MPI to efficiently compute low-rank approximations leveraging parallelisation on multiple processors. \

**Orthogonalization techniques for a set of vectors** - *Fall 2023* \
Orthogonalizing large sets of vectors is a key step in several numerical algorithms. This project implements and tests three orthogonalization methods using MPI to enable distributed computation. \

**Bike sharing in London** - *Spring 2023* \
This project explores a London bike sharing dataset using R, applying simple statistical tools on Gaussian samples, such as hypothesis testing and ANOVA. \
