# Hey there! 👋

I am Stefano Ferioli and I am currently pursuing a Master in Applied Mathematics at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.
My interests range over many areas, including Statistics, Machine Learning, Computational Linear Algebra, and Numerical Analysis.

## 🎓 **Previous education**

 - Bachelor in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMI), Italy
 - Exchange semester at Linnaeus University (LNU), Sweden

## 📌 **Some interesting projects**

- [`Randomized algorithms for tensor train approximation`](https://github.com/ferioliste/TensorTrainApproximation): a Julia implementation and analysis of some of the most recent TT-factorization and TT-rounding randomized algorithms.
- [`Dealing with sparse rewards in the Mountain Car environment`](https://github.com/ferioliste/MountainCar-RL): an implementation of two reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the Mountain Car problem. At each step the reward is -1 except when the goal is reached where it is 0. The main challenge is the sparse reward function.
- [`Label Propagation via Diffusion on a Graph`](https://github.com/ferioliste/label-propagation): a semi-supervised learning algorithm for labelling exploiting the geometric structure of the data.
<!---
- [`Randomized Nyström Algorithm`](https://github.com/ferioliste/randomized-nystrom): a mpi4py implementation of the Randomized Nyström Algorithm for the lossy compression of big square matrices.
- [`Orthogonalization techniques for a set of vectors`](https://github.com/ferioliste/qr-factorization): mpi4py implementations of some of the most important QR-factorization algorithms.
